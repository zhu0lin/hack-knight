## üêõ Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Portion Sizes** - Vision API estimates "typical" serving, may not match actual
2. **Mixed Dishes** - May categorize complex meals as "other"
3. **Drink Recognition** - Limited for beverages
4. **Nutrition Data** - Calorie estimates are approximate

### Planned Improvements

1. **Portion Detection** - Use object detection to estimate serving size
2. **Multi-Food Detection** - Recognize multiple items in one photo
3. **Barcode Scanning** - Supplement vision with exact nutrition labels
4. **Recipe Analysis** - Break down homemade dishes into ingredients
5. **Meal Planning** - AI-generated meal plans based on goals
6. **Progress Visualization** - Charts showing goal progress over time
