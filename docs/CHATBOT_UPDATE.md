# Chatbot Updates - Concise & Context-Aware

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated System Prompt
**Before:** Friendly, emoji-heavy responses
**After:** Short, concise, professional responses (2-4 sentences max)

New rules:
- No emojis
- Direct and specific answers
- Bullet points only for lists
- Focus on practical advice
- Professional but encouraging tone

### 2. Improved Context Gathering
**Better data organization:**
- Meal count for today
- Category breakdown (Fruits, Vegetables, Protein, Dairy, Grains)
- Total calories
- Missing food groups
- Current streak
- Recent meals (up to 5)

**Example context:**
```
Today's nutrition data:
- Meals logged: 3
- Categories: Fruits (1), Vegetables (0), Protein (2), Dairy (0), Grains (1)
- Total calories: 650
- Missing groups: Vegetables, Dairy
- Current streak: 2 days
- Recent meals: Apple, Chicken breast, Rice
```

### 3. Updated Starter Prompts
**Before:**
- "What food groups am I missing today?"
- "What should I eat for more protein?"
- "Review my meals from today"

**After:**
- "What food groups am I missing today?"
- "What should I eat next?"
- "Give me nutrition tips"

### 4. Concise Quick Actions
- `get_missing_groups_explanation()`: "What food groups am I still missing today?"
- `get_meal_suggestions()`: "Based on what I've eaten, what should I eat next?"
- `get_nutrition_tips()`: "Give me 2-3 quick tips based on my eating today."

## Example Responses

### Question: "What food groups am I missing today?"

**Before (with emojis):**
> "Hey there! Looking at your meals today, I see you've logged some great protein choices! However, you're still missing vegetables and dairy from your food groups. Try adding a colorful salad for veggies and maybe some Greek yogurt or cheese for dairy to complete your nutrition goals today!"

**After (concise):**
> "You're missing vegetables and dairy. Add a serving of leafy greens or bell peppers, and include yogurt or cheese to complete all food groups."

### Question: "What should I eat next?"

**Before:**
> "Based on what you've eaten so far today, I'd recommend focusing on getting some vegetables and dairy into your next meal! You could try a veggie-packed stir-fry with tofu, or maybe a Greek salad with feta cheese. Both options would help you hit those missing food groups while staying nutritious and delicious!"

**After:**
> "Focus on vegetables and dairy. Try a Greek salad with feta, or stir-fried veggies with cottage cheese on the side."

## Benefits

1. **Faster to read** - Users get answers quickly without scrolling
2. **More professional** - No emojis keeps it business-like
3. **Context-aware** - Uses real Supabase data (meals, streaks, categories)
4. **Actionable** - Direct recommendations instead of fluff
5. **Works for both**:
   - **Authenticated users**: Get personalized advice based on their meals
   - **Anonymous users**: Get general nutrition advice

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `backend/services/chatbot_service.py` - Core chatbot logic
- `frontend/components/ChatDialog.tsx` - Starter prompts

### Data Sources:
- `food_logs` table - User's meals and calories
- `daily_nutrition_summary` table - Category counts and missing groups
- `user_streaks` table - Streak information
- Real-time calculation of category counts from today's meals

### No Restart Needed:
Since the backend runs with `--reload`, changes to Python files are automatically picked up!

## Testing

Try these questions in the chatbot:
1. "What food groups am I missing today?"
2. "What should I eat next?"
3. "Give me nutrition tips"
4. "How many calories have I eaten?"
5. "What's my current streak?"

All responses should be short (2-4 sentences), have no emojis, and use your actual Supabase data!
