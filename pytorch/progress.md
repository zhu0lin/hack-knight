COMPLETED STEPS:
✅ Step 1: Decided on ResNet50 architecture

    50-layer CNN with skip connections
    Pre-trained on ImageNet
    Will be fine-tuned for food classification

✅ Step 2: Selected Nutrition5k dataset

    Has nutritional metadata (protein, fat, carbs)
    Has ingredient information for dairy/fruit/veg detection

✅ Step 3: Created mapping script

    Converts nutritional values → 5 pyramid categories
    Script in artifact: "Nutrition5k Multi-Label Mapping Script"
    Outputs: nutrition5k_labels.csv with binary labels


NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE:
Step 4: Download and Setup Nutrition5k Dataset

    Clone repository
    Extract images and metadata
    Run mapping script to generate labels CSV

Step 5: Build PyTorch Dataset & DataLoader

    Custom Dataset class that loads images + multi-labels
    Data augmentation (random crops, flips, color jitter)
    Train/validation split (80/20)

Step 6: Build ResNet50 Model

    Load pre-trained ResNet50
    Replace final layer with custom head (5 outputs)
    Use BCEWithLogitsLoss (Binary Cross Entropy for multi-label)

Step 7: Training Loop

    Optimizer: Adam or SGD
    Learning rate: 0.001 with scheduler
    Batch size: 32 or 64
    Epochs: 20-30
Metrics: F1-score per category, mAP (mean Average Precision)

Step 8: Evaluation & Testing

    Test on validation set
    Check per-category performance
    Adjust thresholds if needed

Step 9: Inference Pipeline

    Load trained model
    Preprocess new food image
    Get predictions for all 5 categories
    Display results
